## Detailed Development Patterns

### CardUtils Shared Module System
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Centralized card configurations - use CardUtils for ALL card operations
const cardConfig = window.CardUtils.getCardTypeConfig('W');
// Returns: {name: 'Work', icon: 'üî®', color: 'var(--primary-blue)', bgColor: '#e3f2fd', borderColor: 'var(--primary-blue)'}

const displayName = window.CardUtils.getCardDisplayName('B');  // "Bank Cards"
const formattedValue = window.CardUtils.formatCardValue(card);  // "$150,000" or "3 days"
const sortedCards = window.CardUtils.sortCardsByType(cards);   // Sorted by W, B, I, L, E order

// ‚úÖ Standardized card type validation
if (window.CardUtils.isValidCardType(cardType)) {
    const icon = window.CardUtils.getCardIcon(cardType);
    const color = window.CardUtils.getCardColor(cardType);
}

// ‚ùå FORBIDDEN: Hardcoded card mappings (creates inconsistencies)
const cardTypes = { 'B': 'Business', 'I': 'Investigation' };  // WRONG NAMES!
const icons = { 'W': 'üîß', 'B': 'üíº' };  // Use CardUtils instead

// ‚ùå FORBIDDEN: Local card configuration functions
function getCardTypeConfig(type) { /* duplicate implementation */ }  // Use CardUtils
```

**Critical Fixes Made:**
- **HandManager.js**: Fixed incorrect card names (Business‚ÜíBank, Inspection‚ÜíInvestor, Legal‚ÜíLife, Emergency‚ÜíExpeditor)
- **AdvancedCardManager.js**: Fixed Investment‚ÜíInvestor in card type mapping
- **PlayerStatusPanel.js**: Replaced duplicate icon/color functions with CardUtils calls
- **ActionPanel.js**: Eliminated hardcoded card type names array

### Data-Driven Actions
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Let CSV drive the logic
const space = CSVDatabase.spaces.find(player.position, visitType);
if (space.requires_dice_roll === 'Yes') {
  this.showDiceRoll();
}
if (space.w_card) {
  this.processCardAction(space.w_card, 'W');
}
```

### Error Handling
```javascript
try {
  const data = CSVDatabase.query(type, filters);
  if (!data || data.length === 0) {
    throw new Error(`No ${type} data found for filters`);
  }
  this.processData(data);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Data error:', error);
  this.setState({error: error.message});
}
```

### Component Cleanup
```javascript
componentWillUnmount() {
  GameStateManager.off('eventName', this.handleEvent);
  this.timers?.forEach(clearTimeout);
  this.refs = null;
}
```

### Advanced Component Patterns

#### InteractiveFeedback Usage
```javascript
// Show toast notifications
window.InteractiveFeedback.success('Player moved successfully!');
window.InteractiveFeedback.warning('Insufficient funds');
window.InteractiveFeedback.error('Invalid move');

// Show loading states
const loadingId = window.InteractiveFeedback.showLoading(buttonElement, 'Processing...');
window.InteractiveFeedback.hideLoading(loadingId);
```

#### TooltipSystem Integration
```javascript
// Add tooltips via data attributes
<button data-tooltip="Click to roll dice" data-tooltip-theme="info">Roll Dice</button>

// Or configure programmatically for specific selectors
tooltipConfigs.current.set('.special-button', {
    title: 'Special Action',
    content: 'This button performs a special game action',
    delay: 500,
    theme: 'success'
});
```

#### Card Combo Detection
```javascript
// Combo opportunities are automatically detected
const opportunities = window.AdvancedCardManager.getComboOpportunities();
opportunities.forEach(combo => {
    console.log(`${combo.name}: ${combo.description}`);
    // Bonus: +$${combo.bonus.money}, multiplier: ${combo.bonus.multiplier}x
});
```

#### Logic Space Implementation
```javascript
// Logic spaces automatically trigger when players land on them
// CSV data drives the decision logic:
// Event: "Do you want to proceed with this approach? (Yes/No)"
// The LogicSpaceManager handles the UI and outcome processing
```

#### Advanced Dice Outcomes
```javascript
// Dice outcomes support complex patterns in CSV:
// "If roll >= 4: Draw W card" - conditional card draws
// "$1000 per roll point" - variable money based on roll value
// "Move to SPACE-A or SPACE-B" - multiple movement options
```

### State Management
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Always preserve existing state
this.setState(prevState => ({ 
    ...prevState, 
    newProperty: value 
}));
```

---

## Debugging

### CSV Data Issues
```javascript
// Enable CSV query logging
CSVDatabase.debug = true;

// Enable event system logging  
GameStateManager.debug = true;

// Component-specific debugging
window.DEBUG_COMPONENT = 'ComponentName';
```

### Common Issues Resolution
```bash
# ‚úÖ FIXED: Space LEND-SCOPE-CHECK - To get more $/First not found
# CAUSE: CSV contained descriptions mixed with space names
# SOLUTION: Cleaned all standard movement fields

# ‚úÖ FIXED: Space REG-FDNY-PLAN EXAM/First not found  
# CAUSE: Space name inconsistency (space vs dash)
# SOLUTION: Standardized naming across all CSV files

# ‚úÖ FIXED: REG-DOB-PLAN-EXAM movement problems
# CAUSE: Dice outcomes contained descriptions  
# SOLUTION: Cleaned all dice outcome columns

# ‚úÖ FIXED: Layout blue wasteland taking 50% of screen
# CAUSE: Conflicting CSS files and old layout system
# SOLUTION: CSS overrides with !important and layout restructure

# ‚ÑπÔ∏è INTENTIONAL: REG-FDNY-FEE-REVIEW complex logic
# STATUS: Uses conditional movement logic (not a bug)
# HANDLING: Special game logic processes these conditions
```

---

## CSV Data Integrity

### Current Status of CSV Data Cleanliness
```csv
# ‚úÖ CLEAN - Standard space movements
space_1,space_2,space_3
LEND-SCOPE-CHECK,ARCH-INITIATION,CHEAT-BYPASS

# ‚úÖ CLEAN - All dice outcomes  
1,2,3,4,5,6
REG-FDNY-FEE-REVIEW,REG-DOB-PLAN-EXAM,ARCH-INITIATION,ARCH-INITIATION,REG-FDNY-FEE-REVIEW,REG-FDNY-FEE-REVIEW

# ‚ö†Ô∏è COMPLEX - Logic-based spaces (handled by special game logic)
space_1,space_2,space_3,space_4,space_5
"Did you pass FDNY approval before? YES - Space 2 - NO - Space 3","Did the scope change since...","Did Department of Buildings...","Do you have: sprinklers...","Do you have DOB approval? YES - PM-DECISION-CHECK or CON-INITIATION NO - REG-DOB-TYPE-SELECT"
```

### Current Data State
- ‚úÖ **Dice outcomes**: 100% clean (no descriptions)
- ‚úÖ **Standard space movements**: Clean space names only
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Logic spaces**: REG-FDNY-FEE-REVIEW uses conditional logic (intentional)
- üìÅ **Legacy Files**: Removed - clean CSV architecture implemented
- üõ†Ô∏è **Cleanup scripts available**: For future data maintenance if needed

### CSV Validation Checklist
- ‚úÖ All space_1 through space_5 contain clean space names only
- ‚úÖ All dice outcome columns (1-6) contain clean space names only  
- ‚úÖ Space names validated across all clean CSV architecture files
- ‚úÖ No descriptions after " - " in movement/outcome fields
- ‚úÖ Consistent naming (dashes vs spaces vs underscores)

### CSV Movement Data Rules
- **Simple movements**: Must be clean space names only
- **Logic movements**: Complex conditions handled by special game logic
- **Never mix**: Don't put descriptions in simple movement fields
