# DEVELOPMENT TRACKING

**Project Management Board Game - Production Status**

## Current Status: PRODUCTION READY ✅ 

**LATEST ACHIEVEMENT:** Implemented complete card replacement system with event-driven architecture - players can now replace cards at PM-DECISION-CHECK space with full modal UI selection.

**CURRENT STATE:** Production-ready game with fully functional card drawing, dice mechanics, turn management, and card replacement. All systems use CSV-driven data architecture with proper event-driven communication.

## Detailed Work Log

### 2025-08-14: Card Replacement System - Complete Implementation

**MAJOR FEATURE:** Fully functional card replacement system from CSV to UI

**Problem Analysis:**
- **Issue**: PM-DECISION-CHECK space has "replace" condition in CSV but button showed "Draw 1 E Card"
- **Root Cause**: `ComponentUtils.js` was hardcoding "Draw" text regardless of CSV condition
- **Architecture Gap**: No mechanism for players to select which cards to replace

**Implementation - Event-Driven Architecture:**

1. **CSV Parsing Fix** (`ComponentUtils.js:377-382`):
   ```javascript
   // BEFORE - Always showed "Draw"
   action = `Draw ${effect.effect_value || 1}`;
   
   // AFTER - Condition-aware
   if (effect.condition === 'replace') {
       action = `Replace ${effect.effect_value || 1}`;
   } else {
       action = `Draw ${effect.effect_value || 1}`;
   }
   ```

2. **CardReplacementModal** - Event-driven modal component:
   - **Listens for**: `showCardReplacementModal` events
   - **Emits**: `cardReplacementConfirmed` events
   - **Features**: Card selection UI, unique key handling, defensive checks

3. **GameStateManager Event Handlers**:
   - `handleShowCardReplacement()`: Validates player data, emits modal events
   - `handleCardReplacementConfirmed()`: Executes replacement (remove old + draw new)
   - **Defensive**: Handles case where player has no cards to replace (fallback to draw)

4. **CardActionsSection Integration**:
   - Detects `condition === 'replace'` and routes to replacement system
   - Passes condition data through event chain

**Technical Achievements:**
- ✅ **Data-Driven**: Button text reflects CSV data (`Replace 1 E Card`)
- ✅ **Event Architecture**: Uses existing `emit`/`useEventListener` patterns
- ✅ **UI Consistency**: Modal uses unified Card component system
- ✅ **State Management**: GameStateManager remains single source of truth
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Prevents infinite recursion, handles edge cases

**Result**: Players can now visit PM-DECISION-CHECK, click "Replace 1 E Card", select cards from modal, and complete replacement with acknowledgment system.

### 2025-08-13: Unified Card System & Critical Bug Fixes

**Card.js fontSize Bug Resolution**:
- **Problem**: React warning "NaN is an invalid value for the fontSize css style property"
- **Root Cause**: Arithmetic operations on fontSize strings like '12px' - 1 = NaN
- **Solution**: Added parseInt() parsing before calculations: `parseInt(sizeConfig.fontSize) - 1 + 'px'`
- **Locations Fixed**: Effect description, flavor text, phase restriction indicator, action buttons
- **Result**: Eliminated React warnings and restored proper font sizing

**CardAcknowledgmentModal Unified Integration**:
- **Problem**: "Card Drawn" modal used custom rendering, different appearance from other cards
- **Impact**: Inconsistent UI experience, duplicate rendering logic (190+ lines)
- **Solution**: Replaced entire custom card display with unified Card component
- **Implementation**:
  ```javascript
  // BEFORE - 190+ lines of custom rendering
  React.createElement('div', { /* complex custom card layout */ });
  
  // AFTER - Clean unified approach
  React.createElement(window.Card, {
      card: card,
      size: 'large',
      onClick: handleCardClick
  });
  ```

**Card Height Restrictions Removal**:
- **Problem**: Large cards in modals not showing full content due to height constraints
- **Root Cause**: `minHeight` and `WebkitLineClamp` properties truncating text content
- **Solution**: Removed restrictions to allow dynamic content expansion
- **Result**: Complete card information display without truncation

**DICE_EFFECTS.csv Data Integrity**:
- **Problem**: Column headers used `cards` instead of specific card type columns (`l_cards`, `e_cards`) for LEND-SCOPE-CHECK space
- **Impact**: L and E card filtering logic failed, preventing proper dice-based card actions
- **Solution**: Fixed column headers from `cards` to `l_cards` and `e_cards` in DICE_EFFECTS.csv
- **Result**: L and E card dice actions now filter and display correctly

### 2025-08-10: Phase 21 - Conditional Card Drawing & Manual Funding System

**Conditional Card Drawing System**:
- **Problem**: OWNER-FUND-INITIATION space was drawing both B and I cards simultaneously from mutually exclusive conditions 
- **Root Cause**: Space effects processing lacked conditional logic evaluation
- **Solution**: Implemented `evaluateEffectCondition()` and `processMutuallyExclusiveCardEffects()` methods in GameStateManager
- **Technical Implementation**:
  ```javascript
  // GameStateManager.js - Conditional Logic
  evaluateEffectCondition(condition, player) {
      switch (condition) {
          case 'scope_le_4M': return player.scope <= 4000000;
          case 'scope_gt_4M': return player.scope > 4000000;
          default: return true;
      }
  }
  ```
- **Data Layer**: Fixed `card_type` column assignments in SPACE_EFFECTS.csv for proper B/I card distribution
- **Result**: Project scope now correctly determines Bank cards (≤$4M) vs Investment cards (>$4M)

**Manual Funding Card Draw Feature**:
- **Problem**: Funding cards auto-drawn on space entry, removing player agency
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `triggerFundingCardDraw()` method to GameStateManager
  - Implemented funding button in CardActionsSection.js with scope-based tooltips
  - Added state tracking with `fundingCardDrawnForSpace` to prevent duplicate draws
  - Integrated with turn completion system via `playerActionTaken` event emission
- **UX Enhancement**: Button shows contextual messaging - "Get Bank Card" (≤$4M) or "Get Investment Card" (>$4M)

### 2025-08-08: Data-Driven Card Actions System

**Problem Resolved**: Missing manual dice action buttons on PM-DECISION-CHECK, INVESTOR-FUND-REVIEW, and LEND-SCOPE-CHECK spaces

**Technical Solutions**:
1. **Data Layer Enhancement**: Added `trigger_type` column to SPACE_EFFECTS.csv
2. **Data-Driven Filtering Logic**: Replaced hardcoded space arrays with CSV-driven filtering
3. **Enhanced ComponentUtils**: Updated condition evaluation for player-choice conditions
4. **Code Simplification**: Removed duplicate filtering logic, centralized decisions in CSV data

### 2025-08-06: Data-Driven Card Activation Refactoring

**Technical Debt Resolution**:
- **Problem**: GameStateManager.addCardsToPlayer used hardcoded `if (cardType !== 'E')` check
- **Solution**: Refactored to use `activation_timing` column from cards.csv for behavior control
- **Changes Made**:
  - **E Cards**: Updated `activation_timing` from "Immediate" to "Player Controlled" (47 cards)
  - **W, B, I, L Cards**: Maintained "Immediate" activation timing (358 cards)
- **Result**: Fully data-driven card activation system

### 2025-08-05: Critical Bug Fixes

**Expeditor Card Effect Duplication**:
- **Root Cause**: CardsInHand.js manually processed E card effects, duplicating EffectsEngine processing
- **Solution**: Replaced duplicate manual processing with unified `GameStateManager.usePlayerCard()` call
- **Result**: E cards now apply effects exactly once when used

**Turn Counter Regression**:
- **Problem**: Counter incremented per player turn instead of per game round
- **Solution**: Implemented proper game round logic in endTurn() method
- **Game Round Logic**: New round starts when advancing to first player (index 0)
- **Result**: Turn counter now represents true game rounds as intended

**Skip Turn Functionality**:
- **Implementation**: Multi-part solution across GameStateManager.js and EffectsEngine.js
- **Components**: Player state tracking, turn logic enhancement, card processing
- **Result**: Cards L014, E029, E030 now properly skip turns and advance turn counter

## Architecture Status
- **CSV-as-Database**: All game content driven by CSV data
- **Event-Driven**: No direct component-to-component calls
