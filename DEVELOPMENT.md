# DEVELOPMENT TRACKING

**Project Management Board Game - Production Status**

## Current Status: PRODUCTION READY ✅ 

**LATEST ACHIEVEMENT:** All core systems operational with unified card acknowledgment system and enhanced dice rolling integration.

**CURRENT STATE:** Production-ready game with fully functional card drawing, dice mechanics, and turn management. All systems use CSV-driven data architecture with proper event-driven communication.

## Recent Major Achievements

### 2025-08-13: Card Acknowledgment & Unified Drawing System
- ✅ **Unified Card Flow:** All cards route through acknowledgment modal system  
- ✅ **Effect Timing Control:** CSV `activation_timing` controls immediate vs player-controlled behavior
- ✅ **Enhanced Dice Integration:** Supports all card effect types with `playerActionTaken` events
- ✅ **Manual Funding System:** Player-initiated funding with scope-based conditional logic

### 2025-08-10: Conditional Card Drawing & Manual Funding
- ✅ **Conditional Logic Engine:** Scope-based B/I card distribution (≤$4M vs >$4M)
- ✅ **Manual Funding Control:** Player-initiated funding card acquisition with state tracking
- ✅ **Turn Integration:** Manual actions properly advance turn completion system

### Previous Resolved Systems
- ✅ **Data-Driven Architecture:** CSV `trigger_type` and `activation_timing` control all behavior
- ✅ **Turn Management:** Game round logic with skip turn support
- ✅ **Card Effects:** Unified processing through GameStateManager with no duplication
- ✅ **UI State Management:** Event-driven updates with proper state synchronization

## Architecture Status
- **CSV-as-Database**: All game content driven by CSV data
- **Event-Driven**: No direct component-to-component calls  
- **Immutable Updates**: All state changes through GameStateManager methods
- **Single Source of Truth**: GameStateManager controls all game state modifications

## Historical Development Log
