# DEVELOPMENT TRACKING

**Project Management Board Game - Production Status**

## Current Status: PRODUCTION READY ✅ 

**LATEST ACHIEVEMENT:** Fixed critical dice-based card action filtering bugs with DICE_EFFECTS.csv data integrity improvements and enhanced CardActionsSection debugging capabilities.

**CURRENT STATE:** Production-ready game with fully functional card drawing, dice mechanics, and turn management. All systems use CSV-driven data architecture with proper event-driven communication.

**For detailed work log and technical implementation details, see `CLAUDE.md`.**

## Architecture Status
- **CSV-as-Database**: All game content driven by CSV data
- **Event-Driven**: No direct component-to-component calls  
- **Immutable Updates**: All state changes through GameStateManager methods
- **Single Source of Truth**: GameStateManager controls all game state modifications

## Next Priorities

### **Priority 1: UI/UX Enhancement** 
✅ **COMPLETED**: Unified card system with consistent display across all contexts
✅ **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive card effect rendering (20+ CSV fields)
✅ **COMPLETED**: Visual phase restriction indicators with color coding
✅ **COMPLETED**: Bug fixes for fontSize calculations and height restrictions

**Remaining:**
- Player position indicators on game board
- Path visualization between spaces  
- Win condition tracker displays
- Action cost contextualization on buttons

### **Priority 2: Strategic Information Display**  
- Constraint indicators for budget/time limits
- Project scope information consolidation
- Player action history log

### **Priority 3: Performance Dashboard**
- Real-time Normalized Performance Score display
- Formula: `score = moneyRemaining - (timeSpent * 100)`
- Event-driven updates for player money/time changes
