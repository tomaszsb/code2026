# DEVELOPMENT TRACKING

**Project Management Board Game - Clean Architecture Rebuild**

## Current Status: Phase 1 Complete ✅

### Phase 1: Clean Architecture Foundation (COMPLETE)

**Completed Components:**
- ✅ CSVDatabase.js - Unified query system for all CSV data
- ✅ GameStateManager.js - Event-driven state management with immutable updates
- ✅ Component hierarchy: App > PlayerSetup/GameBoard > SpaceDisplay
- ✅ Git repository with clean commit history
- ✅ Player initialization starting at OWNER-SCOPE-INITIATION (correct first space)

**Verified Working:**
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Visit: http://localhost:8000/
# Quick Start button → initializes player at correct space
# GameBoard → shows current space data from CSV
# Debug mode: http://localhost:8000/?debug=true&logLevel=debug
```

**Architecture Verification:**
- ✅ CSV files = single source of truth for game content
- ✅ Unified CSVDatabase API (no scattered .find() calls)
- ✅ Event-driven component communication only
- ✅ No direct component-to-component calls
- ✅ No fallbacks, no hardcoded data
- ✅ Clean separation: CSV = data, JavaScript = logic

**Issues Resolved:**
- ✅ Variable declaration conflicts in singletons
- ✅ Loading order problems with window globals
- ✅ Screen flickering during game initialization
- ✅ Incorrect starting position (was tutorial space)
- ✅ Event system functioning properly

## Phase 2: Core Game Mechanics (READY)

**Priorities:**
1. **Dice Rolling System** - CSV-driven outcomes with visual feedback
2. **Card Actions** - Process Draw/Replace/Remove from space effects  
3. **Player Movement** - Navigate via CSV space_1-5 options
4. **Space Effects** - Time costs, fees, card requirements
5. **Turn Management** - Complete turn cycles with state transitions

**Success Criteria:**
- Players can roll dice and see CSV-driven outcomes
- Card actions execute properly (Draw 3, Replace 1, etc.)
- Players move between spaces following CSV navigation
- Time and money tracking works correctly
- Turn system advances properly

**Architectural Requirements:**
- All game content from CSV (no hardcoded values)
- Use CSVDatabase unified API for all queries
- All actions via GameStateManager events
- Follow CLAUDE.md principles
- Reference code2025 for logic understanding only

## Development Notes

**Key Files:**
- `js/data/CSVDatabase.js` - Core data access layer
- `js/data/GameStateManager.js` - State management and events
- `js/components/App.js` - Root component with screen logic
- `js/components/GameManager.js` - Game logic controller (no UI)
- `js/components/GameBoard.js` - Main game interface
- `data/*.csv` - All game content and rules

**Testing Commands:**
```bash
# Standard development
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Debug mode with logging
http://localhost:8000/?debug=true&logLevel=debug
```

**Git Strategy:**
- Clean commits with detailed messages
- Each major feature gets its own commit
- Use git log for detailed change tracking
