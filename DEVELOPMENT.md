# DEVELOPMENT TRACKING

**Project Management Board Game - Clean Architecture Rebuild**

## Current Status: Phase 3 Complete ✅

### Phase 1: Clean Architecture Foundation (COMPLETE)
- ✅ CSVDatabase.js - Unified query system for all CSV data
- ✅ GameStateManager.js - Event-driven state management with immutable updates
- ✅ Component hierarchy: App > PlayerSetup/GameBoard > SpaceDisplay
- ✅ Clean commit history and documentation

### Phase 2: Architecture Rebuild (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Eliminated over-engineering from code2025 (90%+ code reduction)
- ✅ Implemented CSV-as-database philosophy perfectly
- ✅ Pure event-driven architecture (no direct component calls)
- ✅ Single source of truth for all game data

### Phase 3: Visual Game Interface (COMPLETE)
- ✅ **Visual Game Board** - Dynamic board rendering organized by phases
- ✅ **Player Position Tracking** - Real-time player positions with colored tokens
- ✅ **Dice Rolling Interface** - Modal dice roll with animated effects
- ✅ **Space Interaction System** - Clickable spaces with detailed information
- ✅ **Game Flow Mechanics** - Turn management and player movement
- ✅ **Layout Optimization** - Fixed blue wasteland, improved space visibility

**Visual Improvements Made:**
- Fixed layout issues (eliminated massive blue sidebar)
- Made space tiles larger with full text visibility
- Added phase-specific colors for better organization
- Implemented responsive floating action panel
- Added compact player info bar

## Detailed Development Patterns

### Data-Driven Actions
```javascript
// ✅ Let CSV drive the logic
const space = CSVDatabase.spaces.find(player.position, visitType);
if (space.requires_dice_roll === 'Yes') {
  this.showDiceRoll();
}
if (space.w_card) {
  this.processCardAction(space.w_card, 'W');
}
```

### Error Handling
```javascript
try {
  const data = CSVDatabase.query(type, filters);
  if (!data || data.length === 0) {
    throw new Error(`No ${type} data found for filters`);
  }
  this.processData(data);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Data error:', error);
  this.setState({error: error.message});
}
```

### Component Cleanup
```javascript
componentWillUnmount() {
  GameStateManager.off('eventName', this.handleEvent);
  this.timers?.forEach(clearTimeout);
  this.refs = null;
}
```

### State Management
```javascript
// ✅ Always preserve existing state
this.setState(prevState => ({ 
    ...prevState, 
    newProperty: value 
}));
```

## Debugging

### CSV Data Issues
```javascript
// Enable CSV query logging
CSVDatabase.debug = true;

// Enable event system logging  
GameStateManager.debug = true;

// Component-specific debugging
window.DEBUG_COMPONENT = 'ComponentName';
```

### Common Issues Resolution
```bash
# ✅ FIXED: Space LEND-SCOPE-CHECK - To get more $/First not found
# CAUSE: CSV contained descriptions mixed with space names
# SOLUTION: Cleaned all standard movement fields

# ✅ FIXED: Space REG-FDNY-PLAN EXAM/First not found  
# CAUSE: Space name inconsistency (space vs dash)
# SOLUTION: Standardized naming across all CSV files

# ✅ FIXED: REG-DOB-PLAN-EXAM movement problems
# CAUSE: Dice outcomes contained descriptions  
# SOLUTION: Cleaned all dice outcome columns

# ✅ FIXED: Layout blue wasteland taking 50% of screen
# CAUSE: Conflicting CSS files and old layout system
# SOLUTION: CSS overrides with !important and layout restructure

# ℹ️ INTENTIONAL: REG-FDNY-FEE-REVIEW complex logic
# STATUS: Uses conditional movement logic (not a bug)
# HANDLING: Special game logic processes these conditions
```

## CSV Data Integrity

### Current Status of CSV Data Cleanliness
```csv
# ✅ CLEAN - Standard space movements
space_1,space_2,space_3
LEND-SCOPE-CHECK,ARCH-INITIATION,CHEAT-BYPASS

# ✅ CLEAN - All dice outcomes  
1,2,3,4,5,6
REG-FDNY-FEE-REVIEW,REG-DOB-PLAN-EXAM,ARCH-INITIATION,ARCH-INITIATION,REG-FDNY-FEE-REVIEW,REG-FDNY-FEE-REVIEW

# ⚠️ COMPLEX - Logic-based spaces (handled by special game logic)
space_1,space_2,space_3,space_4,space_5
"Did you pass FDNY approval before? YES - Space 2 - NO - Space 3","Did the scope change since...","Did Department of Buildings...","Do you have: sprinklers...","Do you have DOB approval? YES - PM-DECISION-CHECK or CON-INITIATION NO - REG-DOB-TYPE-SELECT"
```

### Current Data State
- ✅ **Dice outcomes**: 100% clean (no descriptions)
- ✅ **Standard space movements**: Clean space names only
- ⚠️ **Logic spaces**: REG-FDNY-FEE-REVIEW uses conditional logic (intentional)
- 📁 **Backups available**: `Spaces.csv.backup` and `DiceRoll Info.csv.backup`
- 🛠️ **Cleanup scripts available**: For future data maintenance if needed

### CSV Validation Checklist
- ✅ All space_1 through space_5 contain clean space names only
- ✅ All dice outcome columns (1-6) contain clean space names only  
- ✅ Space names match exactly across Spaces.csv and DiceRoll Info.csv
- ✅ No descriptions after " - " in movement/outcome fields
- ✅ Consistent naming (dashes vs spaces vs underscores)

### CSV Movement Data Rules
- **Simple movements**: Must be clean space names only
- **Logic movements**: Complex conditions handled by special game logic
- **Never mix**: Don't put descriptions in simple movement fields

## Testing Commands

### Development Server
```bash
# Standard development
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Testing URLs
http://localhost:8000/                              # Main game
http://localhost:8000/?debug=true&logLevel=debug     # Debug mode
```

### Game Testing Flow
```bash
# Complete gameplay cycle verification:
# 1. Quick Start → initializes player at OWNER-SCOPE-INITIATION
# 2. Take Action → triggers space effects and dice rolls
# 3. Roll Dice → CSV-driven outcomes determine next moves
# 4. Choose Movement → player selects from available space options
# 5. End Turn → advances to next player
# 6. Visual Board → spaces organized by phase with player tokens
```

## Architecture Verification

### ✅ Principles Maintained
- ✅ CSV files = single source of truth for game content
- ✅ Unified CSVDatabase API (no scattered .find() calls)
- ✅ Event-driven component communication only
- ✅ No direct component-to-component calls
- ✅ No fallbacks, no hardcoded data
- ✅ Clean separation: CSV = data, JavaScript = logic

### ✅ Performance & UX
- ✅ Visual game board with phase organization
- ✅ Player pieces visible on current positions
- ✅ Interactive dice rolling with animations
- ✅ Space information panels and modals
- ✅ Responsive layout optimized for screen space
- ✅ Phase-specific color coding
