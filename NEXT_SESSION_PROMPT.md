## Critical Issue: React Rendering Bug

**Status**: Phase 28 - UNRESOLVED React rendering issue preventing game progression

## Problem Summary

The Project Management Board Game has a **critical React rendering bug**:

1. **EnhancedPlayerSetup** "Starting Game..." button correctly updates GameStateManager state
2. **Console logs confirm** state changes: `gamePhase: 'PLAYING'`, `showPlayerSetup: false`  
3. **useGameState hook** receives updates and calls React setState()
4. **Visual DOM never updates** - still shows old state: `gamePhase: 'SETUP'`, `showPlayerSetup: true`

## Current State

- App loads and shows player setup screen correctly
- "Starting Game..." button exists and triggers state changes
- React component tree has multiple debugging elements showing the disconnect
- All React components properly loaded and available
- ErrorBoundary exists and functioning

## Investigation Results

✅ **Confirmed Working**: GameStateManager, useGameState hook, React state updates, component loading
❌ **Not Working**: Visual DOM updates when state changes

## Attempted Fixes (All Failed)

1. Component keys for forced re-renders
2. Complete app remounting with changing keys  
3. Forced re-render on every state change
4. ErrorBoundary wrapping
5. Conditional rendering simplification

## Files Modified During Debug

- `/js/components/App.js` - Added extensive debugging, forced re-render logic
- `/js/utils/ComponentUtils.js` - Added state change logging
- `/index.html` - Added forced app re-render on state changes

## Next Steps Needed

1. **Investigate browser/React conflicts** - Check for multiple React instances
2. **Script loading order** - Verify no race conditions
3. **Browser caching issues** - Clear all caches, try different browser
4. **React version compatibility** - CDN React vs Babel transformer conflicts
5. **Consider reverting to working state** and trying different approach

## How to Start

```
I need help resolving a critical React rendering bug in the Project Management Board Game. The issue is that React state updates correctly (confirmed in console logs) but the DOM doesn't re-render to reflect the changes. The player setup screen gets stuck even though the game state transitions to PLAYING phase. Can you help investigate this rendering disconnect?
```

## Current File State

The codebase has extensive debugging code that should be cleaned up once the core issue is resolved. Focus on the core React rendering problem first, then clean up the debugging code.
