# Next Session Starting Prompt

## Current Status: Phase 34 Complete - EffectsEngine Ready for Integration

**Latest Achievement**: EffectsEngine Phase 0 & 1 implementation complete - all card handlers added and engine initialized in GameManager

## Project Summary

The Project Management Board Game now has a **fully functional EffectsEngine** with all necessary card effect handlers:

1. **✅ Phase 0 Complete** - All 5 card effect handlers implemented:
   - `applyWorkEffect()` - W cards → Project scope integration
   - `applyLoanEffect()` - B cards → Money addition  
   - `applyInvestmentEffect()` - I cards → Money addition
   - `applyLifeBalanceEffect()` - L cards → Time adjustment
   - `applyEfficiencyEffect()` - E cards → Multi-effect processing

2. **✅ Phase 1 Complete** - EffectsEngine initialized in GameManager with CSV database connection
3. **✅ Critical Bug Fixed** - Immutable state updates implemented, time effect rendering bug resolved
4. **✅ Debug Infrastructure** - Global debug functions available for testing

## Current Architecture Status

- **CSV Data Architecture**: Complete and clean (405 cards, 51 fields standardized)
- **GameStateManager**: Enhanced with immutable `updatePlayerTime()` method
- **EffectsEngine**: Fully equipped with all card handlers, initialized and connected
- **Debug Tools**: `window.giveCardToPlayer()` and `window.showGameState()` ready for testing
- **React Components**: All functional, no rendering issues

## Next Session Objective: Card Effect Routing

**Goal**: Connect card usage to EffectsEngine handlers for end-to-end card functionality

### Recommended Next Steps (Option B - Card Handlers First)

**Technical Analysis Complete**: Strategic evaluation determined that connecting card handlers provides:
- Immediate user value (W card → scope functionality)
- Simple 30-minute implementation
- Perfect testing environment with existing debug tools
- Lower risk than space effects integration

### Implementation Plan

1. **Create Card Effect Router** (~15 minutes)
   - Add `applyCardEffect()` master router function to EffectsEngine
   - Route based on `card.immediate_effect` field ("Apply Work", "Apply Loan", etc.)

2. **Add Event Listener** (~15 minutes)
   - Add `cardPlayed` event listener in GameManager
   - Route card usage events to EffectsEngine.applyCardEffect()

3. **Test End-to-End** (~10 minutes)
   - Use `window.giveCardToPlayer('W001', playerId)` to add W card
   - Trigger card usage to test scope integration
   - Verify `window.showGameState()` shows updated scope

## How to Start Next Session

```
I'm ready to continue implementing the Project Management Board Game. We just completed Phase 0 & 1 of EffectsEngine implementation - all card effect handlers are ready and the engine is initialized in GameManager. 

Our next objective is to create a card effect routing system so that when players use cards, they route through the EffectsEngine to the appropriate handler (like applyWorkEffect for W cards). 

We decided on "Option B" - implementing card handlers first because it provides immediate user value and a perfect testing environment. Can you help me create the card effect router function and event listener to connect card usage to our new EffectsEngine handlers?

## Files Recently Modified

- **js/utils/EffectsEngine.js** - Added 5 card effect handler functions
- **js/components/GameManager.js** - Added EffectsEngine initialization and debug tools
- **js/data/GameStateManager.js** - Added immutable updatePlayerTime() method
- **DEVELOPMENT.md** - Updated with Phase 34 completion status
- **CLAUDE.md** - Updated architecture documentation

## Testing Framework Ready

All debug tools are functional and ready for immediate card effect testing:
- `window.giveCardToPlayer(cardId, playerId)` - Add any card to player hand
- `window.showGameState()` - Inspect live game state and player data
- `window.GameManagerEffectsEngine` - Direct access to EffectsEngine instance

**Status**: Ready to implement card effect routing and achieve end-to-end W card → scope functionality!
