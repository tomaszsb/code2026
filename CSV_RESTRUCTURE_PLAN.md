# CSV Data Structure Restructure Plan

## ✅ RESTRUCTURE COMPLETED

**Status:** The CSV restructuring described in this plan has been successfully implemented in code2026 with all benefits achieved.

## Original Problem Analysis (SOLVED)

The original CSV files mixed multiple concerns, making the code complex and error-prone:

### Issues with Current Structure:

**Spaces.csv** - Doing too much (22 columns):
```csv
space_name,phase,visit_type,Event,Action,Outcome,w_card,b_card,i_card,l_card,e_card,Time,Fee,space_1,space_2,space_3,space_4,space_5,Negotiate,requires_dice_roll,path,rolls
```

Problems:
- ❌ Movement logic mixed with effects
- ❌ Story text mixed with game rules  
- ❌ Complex parsing: `"Draw 1 if scope ≤ $ 4 M"`
- ❌ Hard to code: multiple data types in single row
- ❌ Difficult to maintain: changes affect multiple systems

**DiceRoll Info.csv** - Multiple effect types:
```csv
space_name,die_roll,visit_type,1,2,3,4,5,6
OWNER-SCOPE-INITIATION,W Cards,First,Draw 1,Draw 1,Draw 2,Draw 2,Draw 3,Draw 3
ARCH-FEE-REVIEW,Fees Paid,First,8%,8%,10%,10%,12%,12%
CHEAT-BYPASS,Next Step,First,ENG-INITIATION,REG-DOB-FEE-REVIEW,REG-FDNY-FEE-REVIEW,CON-INITIATION,PM-DECISION-CHECK,PM-DECISION-CHECK
```

Problems:
- ❌ Mixed data types (cards, money, movement) in same structure
- ❌ Hard to parse different effect types
- ❌ Inconsistent data format across rows

## Proposed Clean Structure

### 1. **Movement Data** - `MOVEMENT.csv`
**Purpose**: Pure space-to-space connections  
**Used by**: MovementEngine

```csv
space_name,visit_type,movement_type,destination_1,destination_2,destination_3,destination_4,destination_5
START-QUICK-PLAY-GUIDE,First,fixed,OWNER-SCOPE-INITIATION,,,,
OWNER-SCOPE-INITIATION,First,dice,OWNER-FUND-INITIATION,,,,
OWNER-FUND-INITIATION,First,fixed,PM-DECISION-CHECK,,,,
PM-DECISION-CHECK,First,choice,LEND-SCOPE-CHECK,ARCH-INITIATION,CHEAT-BYPASS,,
PM-DECISION-CHECK,Subsequent,choice,LEND-SCOPE-CHECK,ARCH-INITIATION,CHEAT-BYPASS,PM-DECISION-CHECK,OWNER-DECISION-REVIEW
LEND-SCOPE-CHECK,First,dice,BANK-FUND-REVIEW,INVESTOR-FUND-REVIEW,,,
BANK-FUND-REVIEW,First,fixed,PM-DECISION-CHECK,,,,
INVESTOR-FUND-REVIEW,First,fixed,PM-DECISION-CHECK,,,,
ARCH-INITIATION,First,dice,ENG-INITIATION,,,,
ENG-INITIATION,First,dice,REG-DOB-FEE-REVIEW,,,,
REG-DOB-FEE-REVIEW,First,choice,REG-DOB-PLAN-EXAM,REG-DOB-PROF-CERT,,,
CON-INITIATION,First,fixed,CON-ISSUES,,,,
FINISH,First,none,,,,,
```

**Coding Benefits**:
```javascript
// Simple, focused parsing
const destinations = row.destination_1, row.destination_2, etc.
const movementType = row.movement_type; // 'fixed', 'dice', 'choice'

// Clean logic
if (movementType === 'choice') {
  showChoiceModal(destinations);
} else if (movementType === 'dice') {
  requireDiceRoll(destinations);
}
```

### 2. **Dice Outcomes** - `DICE_OUTCOMES.csv`
**Purpose**: What happens when you roll dice  
**Used by**: DiceEngine

```csv
space_name,visit_type,roll_1,roll_2,roll_3,roll_4,roll_5,roll_6
OWNER-SCOPE-INITIATION,First,OWNER-FUND-INITIATION,OWNER-FUND-INITIATION,OWNER-FUND-INITIATION,OWNER-FUND-INITIATION,OWNER-FUND-INITIATION,OWNER-FUND-INITIATION
LEND-SCOPE-CHECK,First,BANK-FUND-REVIEW,BANK-FUND-REVIEW,BANK-FUND-REVIEW,INVESTOR-FUND-REVIEW,INVESTOR-FUND-REVIEW,INVESTOR-FUND-REVIEW
ARCH-INITIATION,First,ENG-INITIATION,ENG-INITIATION,ENG-INITIATION,ARCH-FEE-REVIEW,ARCH-FEE-REVIEW,ARCH-FEE-REVIEW
ARCH-INITIATION,Subsequent,PM-DECISION-CHECK,PM-DECISION-CHECK,PM-DECISION-CHECK,ARCH-FEE-REVIEW,ARCH-FEE-REVIEW,ARCH-FEE-REVIEW
CON-INITIATION,First,CON-ISSUES,CON-ISSUES,CON-ISSUES,CON-ISSUES,CON-ISSUES,CON-ISSUES
CON-ISSUES,First,CON-INSPECT,CON-INSPECT,REG-FDNY-FEE-REVIEW,REG-DOB-FEE-REVIEW,ENG-INITIATION,ARCH-INITIATION
REG-DOB-PLAN-EXAM,First,REG-FDNY-FEE-REVIEW,REG-DOB-PLAN-EXAM,ARCH-INITIATION,ARCH-INITIATION,REG-FDNY-FEE-REVIEW,REG-FDNY-FEE-REVIEW
```

**Coding Benefits**:
```javascript
// Super simple dice resolution
const destination = diceOutcome[`roll_${diceValue}`];
movePlayer(player, destination);
```

### 3. **Space Effects** - `SPACE_EFFECTS.csv`
**Purpose**: All card, time, and money effects  
**Used by**: EffectsEngine

**Coding Benefits**:
```javascript
// Clean effect processing
effects.forEach(effect => {
  if (meetsCondition(effect.condition, gameState)) {
    switch(effect.effect_type) {
      case 'time':
        if (effect.effect_action === 'add') {
          addTime(player, effect.effect_value);
        }
        break;
      case 'cards':
        if (effect.effect_action === 'draw') {
          drawCards(player, effect.effect_value);
        } else if (effect.effect_action === 'replace') {
          replaceCards(player, effect.effect_value);
        }
        break;
      case 'money':
        if (effect.effect_action === 'fee_percent') {
          applyFee(player, effect.effect_value);
        }
        break;
    }
  }
});
```

**Coding Benefits**:
```javascript
// Clean UI content loading
const content = spaceContent.find(c => c.space_name === spaceName && c.visit_type === visitType);
displayTitle(content.title);
displayStory(content.story);
showNegotiateButton(content.can_negotiate === 'Yes');
```

### 6. **Game Metadata** - `GAME_CONFIG.csv`

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Create New CSV Files
1. Extract movement logic → `MOVEMENT.csv`
2. Extract dice outcomes → `DICE_OUTCOMES.csv`
3. Extract effects → `SPACE_EFFECTS.csv` + `DICE_EFFECTS.csv`
4. Extract content → `SPACE_CONTENT.csv`
5. Create metadata → `GAME_CONFIG.csv`

### Phase 2: Update Code Architecture
Create specialized engines:

```javascript
// Clean separation of concerns
class MovementEngine {
  // Only handles space-to-space movement
  getAvailableMoves(player, spaceName, visitType)
  executeMovement(player, targetSpace)
}

class EffectsEngine {
  // Only handles card/time/money effects
  applySpaceEffects(player, spaceName, visitType)
  applyDiceEffects(player, spaceName, visitType, diceRoll)
}

class ContentEngine {
  // Only handles display content
  getSpaceContent(spaceName, visitType)
  getSpaceTitle(spaceName, visitType)
}

class DiceEngine {
  // Only handles dice mechanics
  getDiceOutcome(spaceName, visitType, rollValue)
  rollDice(sides = 6)
}
```

### Phase 3: Benefits Achieved

**Before (mixed CSV)**:
```javascript
// Complex, error-prone parsing
if (spaceData.w_card === "Draw 3") {
  drawCards('W', 3);
} else if (spaceData.w_card === "Draw 1 if scope ≤ $ 4 M") {
  if (player.scope <= 4000000) {
    drawCards('W', 1);
  }
}

// Movement mixed with effects
const moves = [spaceData.space_1, spaceData.space_2].filter(Boolean);
const time = parseInt(spaceData.Time || '0');
const fee = parseFloat(spaceData.Fee || '0');
```

**After (clean CSVs)**:
```javascript
// Simple, reliable parsing
const movement = MovementEngine.getAvailableMoves(player);
const effects = EffectsEngine.getSpaceEffects(spaceName, visitType);
const content = ContentEngine.getSpaceContent(spaceName, visitType);

effects.forEach(effect => {
  EffectsEngine.applyEffect(player, effect);
});
```

### Data Validation Examples

Each CSV can be validated independently:

```javascript
// Movement validation
function validateMovement(movementData) {
  return movementData.every(row => {
    return row.destination_1 && 
           ['fixed', 'dice', 'choice'].includes(row.movement_type);
  });
}

// Effects validation  
function validateEffects(effectsData) {
  return effectsData.every(row => {
    return ['time', 'cards', 'money'].includes(row.effect_type) &&
           ['add', 'draw', 'replace', 'return'].includes(row.effect_action);
  });
}
```

## Migration Path

### Step 1: Backup Current Files
```bash
cp Spaces.csv Spaces_BACKUP.csv
cp "DiceRoll Info.csv" "DiceRoll_Info_BACKUP.csv"
```

### Step 2: Generate Clean Files
Run data extraction scripts to populate new CSVs from existing data

### Step 3: Update Code Gradually
1. Update MovementEngine to use `MOVEMENT.csv`
2. Update EffectsEngine to use `SPACE_EFFECTS.csv` + `DICE_EFFECTS.csv`
3. Update UI to use `SPACE_CONTENT.csv`
4. Remove old CSV dependencies

### Step 4: Verify Game Logic
Test that all game mechanics work with new structure

## Expected Benefits

1. **Easier Coding**: Single-purpose CSVs with consistent data types
2. **Better Debugging**: Issues isolated to specific systems
3. **Faster Development**: No more parsing complex mixed data
4. **Cleaner Architecture**: Separation of concerns enforced by data structure
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes only affect relevant systems
6. **Better Testing**: Each CSV can be tested independently

This restructure will make your movement and card engines much simpler to implement and maintain!
