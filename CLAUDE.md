## Core Architecture

### CSV-as-Database Philosophy
- **Game DATA lives in CSV files** - card properties, space effects, dice outcomes
- **Game LOGIC lives in JavaScript** - how to process data, UI flow, turn mechanics
- **One unified API** - same query pattern for all CSV data types
- **No data duplication** - CSV is single source of truth for game content

### Key Files
```
js/data/CSVDatabase.js              # Unified CSV query system
js/data/GameStateManager.js         # Central state + events
js/components/App.js                # Root component
js/components/GameBoard.js          # Interactive board with movement system
js/components/SpaceExplorer.js      # Space details and exploration panel

# Modern Panel System (User Interface)
js/components/GamePanelLayout.js    # Responsive three-panel layout container
js/components/PlayerStatusPanel.js  # Left panel: player status, space info, cards
js/components/ActionPanel.js        # Bottom panel: actions, dice, moves, turn control
js/components/ResultsPanel.js       # Right panel: results, history, game progress

# Advanced System Components (Professional Features)
js/components/InteractiveFeedback.js       # Toast notifications & visual feedback
js/components/TooltipSystem.js             # Context-sensitive help system
js/components/LogicSpaceManager.js         # Complex decision-based spaces
js/components/AdvancedCardManager.js       # Card combos & chain effects
js/components/AdvancedDiceManager.js       # Sophisticated dice mechanics
js/components/PlayerInfo.js               # Comprehensive player dashboard
js/components/PlayerMovementVisualizer.js # Visual movement animations

css/unified-design.css          # Design system with consistent styling
css/panel-layout.css            # Three-panel layout styling
data/cards.csv                  # Card properties and effects
data/Spaces.csv                 # Space actions and outcomes
data/DiceRoll Info.csv          # Dice result mappings
```

## Development Rules

### CSV Data Standards
```javascript
// ✅ Query CSV data with unified API
const cards = CSVDatabase.cards.query({type: 'W', phase: 'DESIGN'});
const space = CSVDatabase.spaces.find(spaceName, visitType);
const dice = CSVDatabase.dice.query({space: spaceName, visitType});

// ❌ No direct array manipulation
spaces.find(s => s.space_name === name);  // Forbidden
```

### Component Communication
```javascript
// ✅ Event-driven only
GameStateManager.emit('playerMoved', {player, newSpace});
GameStateManager.on('playerMoved', this.handlePlayerMoved);

// ❌ No direct component calls
otherComponent.updatePlayer(player);  // Forbidden
```

### What's Forbidden
- ❌ **Magic strings in JS** - no `if (spaceName === 'OWNER-SCOPE-INITIATION')`
- ❌ **Hardcoded amounts** - no `drawCards('W', 3)` without CSV lookup
- ❌ **Multiple data access paths** - one API only
- ❌ **Component-to-component calls** - events only
- ❌ **Fallback data sources** - CSV or error, no alternatives

## Loading Order (Critical)
```html
1. Unified Design System (CSS)
2. CSVDatabase system
3. GameStateManager
4. Component utilities  
5. Manager components
6. UI components (GameBoard, SpaceExplorer)
7. Main App
```

## What Lives Where

### CSV Files (Game Content)
- ✅ Space names, actions, card requirements
- ✅ Card effects, costs, descriptions
- ✅ Dice outcomes, movement options

### JavaScript (Game Engine)
- ✅ Turn flow logic (roll dice → move → apply effects)
- ✅ Card effect interpretation ("Draw 3" → drawCards function)
- ✅ UI state management and event coordination
- ✅ Interactive board with clickable spaces and visual feedback
- ✅ Player movement system using CSV space connections

## Reference Materials

### code2025 Folder - REFERENCE ONLY
- 📚 **For understanding existing game logic**
- ❌ **NO mixing of old and new code**
- ❌ **NO importing files from code2025**

### Screenshots and Visual Feedback
- 📸 **Screenshots are uploaded to code2026 folder**
- 📸 **Reference screenshots by filename when discussing layout/UI issues**
