Project Hub NYC PM Game (Version 5.0) ðŸš€
Last Updated: July 26, 2025

## ðŸŽ‰ NEW IN v5.0: UNIFIED AI CONTROL SYSTEM
**Major Infrastructure Enhancement:** Complete AI collaboration system implemented with single-command startup and comprehensive dashboard interface.

1. Project Charter & Vision
1.1. Game Concept: A 27-space digital board game simulating the 6 major phases of an NYC construction project. Players navigate the board making decisions that impact their Time, Money, and Scope.
1.2. Player Role & Goal: The player is a project manager whose primary objective is to complete a project by navigating all 6 phases. Success is measured by efficiency in managing Time, Money, and Scope.
1.3. Core Mechanics & Rules: The game operates on dice-based movement, resource management, and a strategic card system. Key rules are based on real-world principles like sequential regulatory processes.
1.4. Win & Loss Conditions: The primary win condition is reaching the FINISH space. A leaderboard ranks players based on final metrics.
1.5. The "Vibe": A strategic puzzle under mounting pressure, evolving from optimistic and thoughtful to tense and complex.

2. Current Project State
2.1. Implemented Features
âœ… **v5.0 AI Control System**: Complete unified AI collaboration interface with single-command startup, hybrid bridge on port 3003, and comprehensive dashboard controls.
âœ… **v4.8 Centralized Action Tracking**: GameStateManager as single source of truth, eliminated race conditions, simplified UI components, functional action counter.
âœ… **Clean Architecture**: Removed 20+ deprecated files, consolidated command structure, fresh mailbox state.

2.2. Known Issues & Master "Punch List"
NEW: Player Movement Post-Turn Bug: After all required actions are complete and the "End Turn" button is clicked, the player's token does not move to the selected space.
NEW: Cards Not Appearing in Hand Bug: When a player draws cards, the UI in the "Cards in Hand" panel does not update to show the new cards.
NEW: TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'emit') - Occurs after Start Game button click, preventing UI transition.
Environmental Bug (Workaround Found): The browser console enters a loop when the "Enter" key is used. The current workaround is to use the browser's "Snippets" tool for testing.

7. Active Development Plan - v5.0
**Previous Objective:** AI Control System Implementation
**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE
**Current Phase:** Ready for AI collaboration testing and game bug resolution
**AI System:** Fully operational - use `./start-ai-control.sh` â†’ Dashboard â†’ "ðŸš€ Start Both AIs"
**Next Priority:** Collaborative debugging of game issues using new AI control system

8. Version Log
v4.8 (July 23, 2025): Landmark Architectural Refactor. Centralized action-tracking system in GameStateManager, fixed action counter bugs.
v4.9 (July 25, 2025): React State Management Debugging. Fixed re-render loops, improved hook stability.
**v5.0 (July 26, 2025): ðŸš€ AI Control System Complete.** Implemented unified AI collaboration interface with single-command startup (`./start-ai-control.sh`), hybrid bridge server (port 3003), comprehensive dashboard controls, built-in command dictionary, and clean architecture. Added reliable simple auto-responder system (`simple-auto-responder.js`) for instant dashboard communication. Simplified smart scripts for automatic AI responses. Removed 20+ deprecated files. All mailboxes cleared for fresh start. **System fully operational with working auto-responses.**

9. Core Principles & Lessons Learned
9.1. Start with a complete, single-file document.
9.2. The AI PM must protect the Owner from raw code.
9.3. A Master "Punch List" is essential.
9.4. Explicitly instruct AI to check for existing code.
9.5. AI can hallucinate file paths and code structures.
9.6. AI must provide complete, production-ready code.
9.7. A phased approach (Analyze > Plan > Code) prevents wasted effort.
9.8. Always ask the AI to "search for and update" all relevant code.
9.9. Treat every session as if the AI has amnesia.
9.10. Use versioning for the guiding document.
9.11. Formally define team roles.
9.12. Use a "diff" format in prompts.
9.13. Establish and follow a strict session startup protocol.
9.14. (v3.1): Synchronization Must Be Mutual, Not Directive.
9.15. (v3.2): The Translator Must Serve the Visionary.
9.16. (v4.0): Commit Code First, Document Second.
9.17. (v4.0): The Definition of Done Includes All Documentation.
9.18. (v4.0): A Task's "Blast Radius" Includes All Documentation.
9.19. (v4.1): Prompts Must Be Optimized for the Recipient AI.
9.20. (v4.3): Trust, but Verify with Live Tests.
9.21. (v4.3): Acknowledge a Deeper Problem.
9.22. (v4.3): AI Can Go Off-Script.
9.23. (v4.5): The PM's Plan vs. The Programmer's Prompt.
9.24. (v4.5): The AI PM's Prime Directive - Audit Thyself.
9.25. (v4.5): Collaboration is Between AIs.
9.26. (v4.6): Functional Verification Over Component Verification.
9.27. (v4.7): Prompts Must Command, Not Suggest.
9.28. NEW (v4.8): AI-to-AI Prompts Must Delegate, Not Command. A prompt from a PM to a Programmer AI should define the objective and context, then delegate the creation of the technical plan to the expert.
9.29. NEW (v4.8): A Fix Must Be Verified Against the Component's Entire Lifecycle. Verification must validate the component's state at initialization, during interaction, and at completion.
9.30. NEW (v4.8): The Owner's Visual Verification is the Only Source of Truth. A feature or bug fix is not complete until the Owner has visually confirmed that the live application behaves exactly as expected.
9.31. NEW (v4.9): Deep Immutability is Paramount. React's shallow comparison means `getState()` always returning a new object reference (even if content is same) will cause re-renders. Deep equality checks are crucial.
9.32. NEW (v4.9): React Hook Dependencies are Tricky. `useEffect` and `useCallback` dependencies require extreme precision. Race conditions and premature cleanup can arise from incorrect dependencies or synchronous state updates within effects.
9.33. NEW (v4.9): Global vs. Prop References. Mixing global `window` object access with prop-based dependency injection in React components leads to timing issues and `null` reference errors. Components should consistently rely on props for external dependencies.
9.34. NEW (v4.9): Iterative Debugging is Essential, but Isolation is Key. When targeted fixes fail, drastic isolation steps (like simplifying components) are necessary to pinpoint the root cause of persistent issues.
9.35. NEW (v4.9): User Feedback is Invaluable. Detailed symptom descriptions and console output from the user are critical for diagnosing complex, interconnected issues.
9.36. NEW (v5.0): Consolidation Over Confusion. Multiple similar systems create confusion. One unified interface beats many specialized ones.
9.37. NEW (v5.0): Built-in Documentation is Essential. Users need command references readily available, not scattered across files.
9.38. NEW (v5.0): Clean Slate Approach. Starting fresh with cleaned mailboxes and removed deprecated files prevents legacy confusion.
9.39. NEW (v5.0): Single Command Startup. Complex multi-step processes should be reduced to one simple command when possible.
9.40. NEW (v5.0): Simple Solutions Beat Complex Ones. The reliable auto-responder system replaced complex piping/trigger architecture.
9.41. NEW (v5.0): File-Based Communication is Reliable. Direct file monitoring with immediate responses beats complex inter-process communication.
9.42. NEW (v5.0): Shared Auto-Responder Works. One auto-responder handling both Claude and Gemini messages is simpler than separate systems.
