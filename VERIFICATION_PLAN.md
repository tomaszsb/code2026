# Current System Status & Testing Guidelines

## Production Status ✅

**Game State**: Production-ready with all critical systems operational

**Core Functionality**:
- ✅ **Turn Management**: Game rounds advance correctly through all players
- ✅ **Card System**: Unified effect processing with no duplication
- ✅ **UI State**: Clean turn transitions and proper state reset
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive safety checks and graceful degradation

## Testing Procedures

### Basic Functionality Test
```bash
# 1. Start game server
python3 -m http.server 8000

# 2. Navigate to http://localhost:8000/
# 3. Complete player setup and start game
# 4. Verify: Turn counter advances correctly per game round
# 5. Verify: Cards apply effects without duplication
# 6. Verify: UI updates immediately when game state changes
```

### Debug Tools (Browser Console)
```javascript
// View current game state
window.showGameState();

// Test card functionality
window.giveCardToPlayer(playerId, 'W001');
window.GameStateManager.usePlayerCard(playerId, 'W001');

// Check for any console errors (should be clean)
```

## Known Stable Components
- **GameStateManager**: Single source of truth for all state management
- **CSV Database**: Unified query system with loading state protection
- **Card Effects**: Unified processing through EffectsEngine with proper delegation
- **Turn Logic**: Game round tracking with skip turn support
- **UI Components**: Event-driven updates with proper state synchronization

## Architecture Integrity
- **CSV-as-Database**: All game content driven by CSV data
- **Event-Driven**: No direct component-to-component calls
- **Immutable Updates**: All state changes through GameStateManager methods
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive safety checks throughout system
