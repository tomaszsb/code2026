# Verification Plan: TIME COST BUG RESOLUTION & DIAGNOSTIC CLEANUP COMPLETED ✅

## 1. VERIFICATION RESULTS - SESSION 48 ACHIEVEMENTS

**Status: COMPLETED** - Time cost bug resolved and all diagnostic logging cleaned up for production readiness.

**Final State**: The application now properly updates player `timeSpent` at turn end with clean console output. Known issues identified for future investigation.

## 2. SESSION 48 VERIFICATION TESTS - ALL PASSED ✅

### Test 1: Time Cost Processing Chain ✅ RESOLVED
- **Original Issue**: Player `timeSpent` not updating at turn end despite spaces having time costs
- **Root Cause**: Missing space effects processing call at turn end
- **Resolution**: Added space effects processing to turn end sequence
- **Current Status**: Time costs properly applied when players end turns on spaces with time penalties

### Test 2: Database Query Key Fix ✅ RESOLVED
- **Original Issue**: `getSpaceEffects` function using incorrect database key causing lookup failures
- **Root Cause**: Query used `space` instead of `space_name` key
- **Resolution**: Corrected database query key to match CSV schema
- **Current Status**: Space effects queries successfully return time cost data

### Test 3: Effect Processing Logic ✅ RESOLVED
- **Original Issue**: `processSpaceEffect` checking wrong field name for time effects
- **Root Cause**: Function checked `e_time` instead of `time` field
- **Resolution**: Fixed case sensitivity in field name checking
- **Current Status**: Time effects properly detected and processed from CSV data

### Test 4: Duplicate Processing Prevention ✅ RESOLVED
- **Original Issue**: Time costs being applied twice due to redundant function calls
- **Root Cause**: Multiple code paths calling time cost application
- **Resolution**: Eliminated redundant calls in processing chain
- **Current Status**: Time costs applied exactly once per turn end

### Test 5: Diagnostic Cleanup ✅ RESOLVED
- **Original Issue**: Excessive console logging cluttering production output
- **Root Cause**: Temporary diagnostic statements left in 8 component files
- **Resolution**: Systematically removed all DIAGNOSTIC and DEBUG console.log statements
- **Current Status**: Clean console output with only essential error logging preserved

## 3. PREVIOUSLY KNOWN ISSUES - NOW RESOLVED

### Issue 1: Undefined Cards Processing - RESOLVED ✅
- **Description**: Game occasionally attempted to process `undefined` card objects
- **Impact**: Potential runtime errors and game state corruption
- **Resolution**: Fixed through comprehensive card system refactoring in Phase 49, implementing proper card validation and unified GameStateManager.usePlayerCard() processing

### Issue 2: Bank Card Duplication Potential - RESOLVED ✅
- **Description**: Single Bank card was potentially applying monetary value twice
- **Impact**: Incorrect player money balances affecting game fairness
- **Resolution**: Resolved through elimination of duplicate effect processing logic and establishment of single source of truth for all card effects in GameStateManager

## 4. PREVIOUS SESSION VERIFICATION TESTS - ALL PASSED ✅

### Session 47: Dice UI Reset & Turn Transition Cleanup ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issues Resolved**: Dice UI persistence, action state carryover, stale display elements, multiplayer turn confusion
- **Current Status**: Clean turn transitions with proper UI state reset for multiplayer games

### Session 46: Multiplayer Setup & User Experience ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issues Resolved**: Broken multiplayer setup, color picker failures, performance delays, turn display errors, missing player avatars, confusing setup flow
- **Current Status**: Full 4-player functionality with instant startup, unique player identification, and streamlined setup experience

### Earlier Sessions: Core Architecture & Functionality ✅ RESOLVED
- **Issues Resolved**: Game startup crashes, card drawing UI failures, React Hooks violations, race conditions, immutability bugs, CSS stacking context issues
- **Current Status**: Stable foundation with working card system, player movement, and clean architecture ready for feature development
